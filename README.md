# Spring-boot boilerplate with gradle

This is a simple boilerplate that uses gradle to run a spring-boot app with JSP templating. 

This project is ment to be a starting point to play with Spring features without having to worry about configuring the damn thing.

In theory, once you've installed gradle, all you have to do to get started is :
```bash
git clone <insert-github-url-here>
gradle bootRun
```
